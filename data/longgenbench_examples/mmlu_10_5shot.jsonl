It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nChoice: \n(A) The ideas of personal liberty and nationalism conceived during the Enlightenment resulted in radical revolutions that could spread throughout Europe.(B) The conquest of Europe by Napoleon led to the creation of new factions and shifted the European balance of power.(C) The power of monarchs had grown to the point where it needed to be checked by other powers within each nation or domination of civilians would occur.(D) The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.\nQuestion_5: \nWhich of the following best states an argument made by James Madison in The Federalist number 10?\nChoice: \n(A) Honest politicians can prevent factions from developing.(B) Factions are more likely to occur in large republics than in small ones.(C) The negative effects of factionalism can be reduced by a republican government.(D) Free elections are the people's best defense against factionalism.\nAnswer_1: \nThe answer is (B) False, False\nAnswer_2: \nThe answer is (B) Business ethics management\nAnswer_3: \nThe answer is (B) Centromeres\nAnswer_4: \nThe answer is (A) The ideas of personal liberty and nationalism conceived during the Enlightenment resulted in radical revolutions that could spread throughout Europe.\nAnswer_5: \nThe answer is (C) The negative effects of factionalism can be reduced by a republican government.\n\nFollowing Questions: \nQuestion_6: \nThese medicines are antipsychotics and block dopamine receptors in the brain and are a bipolar and schizophrenia treatment.

Environmental change would have a negative impact if resources were available to adapt to environmental change to sustain their existing income levels.'  (C): 'In terms of the social determinants of insecurity, environmental change does not undermine human security in isolation; larger scale processes affect people's sensitivity to environmental changes and their capacity to adapt, whilst past processes shape present insecurities and ongoing processes shape future insecurities.'  (D): 'The concept of environmental human security is an essentially contested concept lacking empirical credibility of the ways in which specific environmental changes affect individuals or communities in particular times/ places and how this alters over a period of time.

On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together. We maintain that this is the only way to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.\"\nMao Zedong, On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation, 1955\nThe developments described in the speech regarding the cooperation of the peasant economy contributed most directly to which of the following global processes?\nChoice: \n(A): 'The decline of Chinese influence in Asia and globally'  (B): 'The expansion of multinational corporations and globalization'  (C): 'The decline of Soviet-style communism and the rise of Maoism'  (D): 'The green revolution and development of more efficient agricultural techniques'  \nQuestion_23: \nA buyer sent an e-mail to a retailer of camping supplies inquiring about the possibility of purchasing a tent that would sleep four adults.

This price is good for one week. \"Three days later, the retailer learned from another seller of camping supplies that the same buyer had come to her store the day before and had inquired about purchasing a tent that would sleep four adults. The other seller told the retailer that she had quoted the buyer a price of $600 for a tent that would sleep four adults. The next day, the buyer telephoned the retailer and stated that he wanted to buy the tent for $500. The retailer replied: \"I do not want to sell to you. I tried to deal with you in good faith, but I hear you've been comparing my prices with other sellers. Why don't you deal with them!\" The retailer then slammed down the phone. Assume that the retailer's e-mail created in the buyer a valid power of acceptance.

The spa also provided health club facilities, such as saunas, steam rooms, and whirlpool baths. A 75-year-old spinster resided across the street from the spa. The spinster opposed the opening of the spa because she believed that it was a \"cover\" for an illegal operation. During the day, the spinster sat in her rocking chair on her front porch and observed a constant stream of businessmen entering the spa. On the evening of June 29, the spinster, disguising her voice, called the spa and told the businessman, \"You pimp, why don't you take your dirty trade elsewhere?\" Without paying any attention to the call, the businessman hung up. The spinster then began making repeated crank telephone calls to the businessman's establishment. Every hour on the hour for the next three weeks, the spinster made her crank calls, harassing the businessman and his employees. As a result of the hourly phone calls, spa business was constantly disrupted, causing the businessman to suffer a decline in the volume of customers.

The contract noted that the earnest money tendered would be applied to the purchase price at the time of sale but was silent as to remedies in the event of any default. Just before the closing, the buyer lost her job. The buyer told the seller that she could no longer purchase the house and asked him to return the earnest money. The seller accurately told the buyer that the seller's actual losses exceeded the amount of the earnest money; that if the seller sued the buyer for damages, he would receive a minimum of $5,000; and that it would be difficult for him to sell the house in the current market. Should the buyer get the earnest money back? \nChoice: \n(A): 'No, because the contract was silent regarding remedies.'  (B): 'No, because the seller's actual losses exceeded the amount of the earnest money.'  (C): 'Yes, because the buyer is no longer ready, willing, and able to purchase the house.'  (D): 'Yes, because the reason for the buyer's default was not anticipated.'  \nQuestion_32: \nA client's insurance company pays 75% of a client\u2019s therapy fee, while the client is required to pay the remaining 25%.

On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together.

It stands for a hundred like her own. She averages three dollars a week. Pay is $1.50 for her room; for breakfast she has a cup of coffee; lunch she cannot afford. One meal a day is her allowance. This woman is young, she is pretty. She has \"the world before her.\" Is it anything less than a miracle if she is guilty of nothing less than the \"early and improvident marriage,\" against which moralists exclaim as one of the prolific causes of the distresses of the poor? Almost any door might seem to offer a welcome escape from such slavery as this. \"I feel so much healthier since I got three square meals a day,\" said a lodger in one of the Girls' Homes. Two young sewing-girls came in seeking domestic service, so that they might get enough to eat. They had been only half-fed for some time, and starvation had driven them to the one door at which the pride of the American-born girl will not permit her to knock, though poverty be the price of her independence.\n\u2014Jacob Riis, How the Other Half Lives, 1890\nWhich of the following would be most likely to support the perspective expressed by Riis in the passage above?\nChoice: \n(A): 'A supporter of Social Darwinism'  (B): 'A Progressive'  (C): 'A businessman'  (D): 'An opponent of immigration'  \nQuestion_24: \nThis question refers to the following information.\nRead the following governmental report.\nOf the 450 sick persons whom the inhabitants were unable to relieve, 200 were turned out, and these we saw die one by one as they lay on the roadside. A large number still remain, and to each of them it is only possible to dole out the least scrap of bread. We only give bread to those who would otherwise die. The staple dish here consists of mice, which the inhabitants hunt, so desperate are they from hunger. They devour roots which the animals cannot eat; one can, in fact, not put into words the things one sees. . . . This narrative, far from exaggerating, rather understates the horror of the case, for it does not record the hundredth part of the misery in this district. Those who have not witnessed it with their own eyes cannot imagine how great it is. Not a day passes but at least 200 people die of famine in the two provinces. We certify to having ourselves seen herds, not of cattle, but of men and women, wandering about the fields between Rheims and Rh\u00e9tel, turning up the earth like pigs to find a few roots; and as they can only find rotten ones, and not half enough of them, they become so weak that they have not strength left to seek food. The parish priest at Boult, whose letter we enclose, tells us he has buried three of his parishioners who died of hunger. The rest subsisted on chopped straw mixed with earth, of which they composed a food which cannot be called bread. Other persons in the same place lived on the bodies of animals which had died of disease, and which the cur\u00e9, otherwise unable to help his people, allowed them to roast at the presbytery fire.\n\u2014Report of the Estates of Normandy, 1651\nWhich of the following intellectual movements was occurring in Europe at the time this document was created and would help improve crop yields?\nChoice: \n(A): 'The Enlightenment'  (B): 'Divine Right theory of rule'  (C): 'The rise of existentialism'  (D): 'The Scientific Revolution'  \nQuestion_25: \nStridor is described as:\nChoice: \n(A): 'A wheezing sound.'

Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nChoice: \n(A) The ideas of personal liberty and nationalism conceived during the Enlightenment resulted in radical revolutions that could spread throughout Europe.(B) The conquest of Europe by Napoleon led to the creation of new factions and shifted the European balance of power.(C) The power of monarchs had grown to the point where it needed to be checked by other powers within each nation or domination of civilians would occur.(D) The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.\nQuestion_5: \nWhich of the following best states an argument made by James Madison in The Federalist number 10?\nChoice: \n(A) Honest politicians can prevent factions from developing.(B) Factions are more likely to occur in large republics than in small ones.(C) The negative effects of factionalism can be reduced by a republican government.(D) Free elections are the people's best defense against factionalism.\nAnswer_1: \nThe answer is (B) False, False\nAnswer_2: \nThe answer is (B) Business ethics management\nAnswer_3: \nThe answer is (B) Centromeres\nAnswer_4: \nThe answer is (A) The ideas of personal liberty and nationalism conceived during the Enlightenment resulted in radical revolutions that could spread throughout Europe.\nAnswer_5: \nThe answer is (C) The negative effects of factionalism can be reduced by a republican government.\n\nFollowing Questions: \nQuestion_6: \nIn a survey of 100 undergraduate math majors at a certain college, the following information is\r\nobtained about the courses they are taking during the Spring semester:\r\n41 are enrolled in real analysis,\r\n44 are enrolled in differential equations, 48 are enrolled in linear algebra,\r\n11 are enrolled in both real analysis and linear algebra,\r\n14 are enrolled in both real analysis and differential equations,\r\n19 are enrolled in both differential equations and linear algebra, and 10 are not enrolled in any of these three courses.\r\nHow many of the students surveyed are enrolled in all three of these courses?\nChoice: \n(A): '1'  (B): '2'  (C): '3'  (D): '4'  \nQuestion_7: \nAs Cold War tensions declined, which three international issues emerged as new interested in the field of peace studies?\nChoice: \n(A): 'Global environmental issues and their potential to limit economic expansion; the economic dependence of newly independent post-colonial states; and the Vietnam war.'

The man was convicted of selling large quantities of an illegal drug from his house. Acting under a state law authorizing the destruction of buildings that are used for illegal activity, the city destroyed the man\u00d5s house. The man\u00d5s family then rented an apartment and demanded that the city pay the rent for that temporary residence. The family relied on a state law providing that any person who was dispossessed of his or her place of residence because of the actions of city officials was entitled to replacement housing at the city\u00d5s expense until permanent substitute housing could be found. When the city refused to pay the rent for the apartment, the man\u00d5s family sued the city in a state trial court claiming a right to such payment under both the state law and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The highest state court ruled for the family. Although the court decided that the family had no right to payment under the state law, it held that the Fourteenth Amendment entitled the family to payment of the rent for the temporary apart-ment. In its opinion, the highest state court indicated that in several of its decisions it had found cities liable for compen-sation in similar situations on the basis of the due process clause of the state constitution. But the highest state court declined to base its holding on the state constitution because that issue had not been properly raised in the case. The city then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the United States Supreme Court. Does the Court have jurisdiction to review the merits of this case?\nChoice: \n(A): 'Yes, because the highest state court based its decision wholly on federal law grounds.'  (B): 'Yes, because the federal and state law issues in this case are so intertwined that a resolution of the federal law issues is necessary to facilitate a proper determination of the state law issues.'

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nChoice: \n(A) The ideas of personal liberty and nationalism conceived during the Enlightenment resulted in radical revolutions that could spread throughout Europe.(B) The conquest of Europe by Napoleon led to the creation of new factions and shifted the European balance of power.(C) The power of monarchs had grown to the point where it needed to be checked by other powers within each nation or domination of civilians would occur.(D) The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.\nQuestion_5: \nWhich of the following best states an argument made by James Madison in The Federalist number 10?\nChoice: \n(A) Honest politicians can prevent factions from developing.(B) Factions are more likely to occur in large republics than in small ones.(C) The negative effects of factionalism can be reduced by a republican government.(D) Free elections are the people's best defense against factionalism.\nAnswer_1: \nThe answer is (B) False, False\nAnswer_2: \nThe answer is (B) Business ethics management\nAnswer_3: \nThe answer is (B) Centromeres\nAnswer_4: \nThe answer is (A) The ideas of personal liberty and nationalism conceived during the Enlightenment resulted in radical revolutions that could spread throughout Europe.\nAnswer_5: \nThe answer is (C) The negative effects of factionalism can be reduced by a republican government.\n\nFollowing Questions: \nQuestion_6: \nA hash function guarantees the integrity of a message.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nChoice: \n(A) The ideas of personal liberty and nationalism conceived during the Enlightenment resulted in radical revolutions that could spread throughout Europe.(B) The conquest of Europe by Napoleon led to the creation of new factions and shifted the European balance of power.(C) The power of monarchs had grown to the point where it needed to be checked by other powers within each nation or domination of civilians would occur.(D) The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.\nQuestion_5: \nWhich of the following best states an argument made by James Madison in The Federalist number 10?\nChoice: \n(A) Honest politicians can prevent factions from developing.(B) Factions are more likely to occur in large republics than in small ones.(C) The negative effects of factionalism can be reduced by a republican government.(D) Free elections are the people's best defense against factionalism.\nAnswer_1: \nThe answer is (B) False, False\nAnswer_2: \nThe answer is (B) Business ethics management\nAnswer_3: \nThe answer is (B) Centromeres\nAnswer_4: \nThe answer is (A) The ideas of personal liberty and nationalism conceived during the Enlightenment resulted in radical revolutions that could spread throughout Europe.\nAnswer_5: \nThe answer is (C) The negative effects of factionalism can be reduced by a republican government.\n\nFollowing Questions: \nQuestion_6: \nA man sued a manufacturer of video and home theater equipment after his home theater started a raging fire, destroying the equipment and part of his home. He sued the manufacturer in federal court. At trial, the defendants filed a motion to preclude the report and testimony of the plaintiff's expert under Fed.R.Evid. 702. The defendants claim bias, lack of scientific support, failure to conduct testing, divergence of opinion among experts, and that the expert was trained for large commercial fires. The expert had investigated over 500 fires, wrote a book that was used in courses nationwide and taught a course in forensic fire investigations in a university. Her report ruled out all other possible causes. The court did a gate-keeping review as required by Rule 702 and ruled that the expert was highly qualified and that she used accepted scientific methodologies in arriving at her opinion. The defendants appealed the ruling. Is the appellate court likely to go against the ruling under these facts?\nChoice: \n(A): 'Yes, because the charge of bias against an expert witness requires a \"trial within a trial\" and that was not done.'  (B): 'Yes, because whenever the expert does not back up her conclusion with experimental testing, an expert's opinion will be insufficiently reliable to be allowed.'  (C): 'No, the court did the required gate-keeping inquiry and found that the witness was not only qualified and competent, but also used the accepted methodologies.'

The same is true in all the other mines: the silver mines of Potosi [and others]\u2026.The owners and stewards of the mines, whether Spaniards, mestizos, or Indians, are such tyrants, with no fear of God or Justice, because they are not audited and are not inspected twice a year\u2026.\nAnd they are not paid for the labor of traveling to and from the mines or for the time they spend at the mines. The Indians, under the pretext of mining chores, are made to spend their workdays herding cattle and conveying goods; they are sent off to the plains, and the Indians die. These Indians are not paid for their labor, and their work is kept hidden.\nAnd [the mine owners] keep Indian cooking women in their residences; they use cooking as a pretext for taking concubines\u2026.And they oblige the Indians to accept corn or meat or chicha [corn beer]\u2026at their own expense, and they deduct the price from their labor and their workdays. In this way, the Indians end up very poor and deep in debt, and they have no way to pay their tribute.\nThere is no remedy for all this, because any [colonial official] who enters comes to an agreement with the mine owners, and all the owners join forces in bribing him\u2026.Even the protector of the Indians is useless;\u2026he [does not] warn Your Majesty or your royal Audiencia [court] about the harms done to the poor Indians.\"\nExcerpt from The First New Chronicle and Good Government [abridged], by Felipe Guaman Poma de Alaya.

The same is true in all the other mines: the silver mines of Potosi [and others]\u2026.The owners and stewards of the mines, whether Spaniards, mestizos, or Indians, are such tyrants, with no fear of God or Justice, because they are not audited and are not inspected twice a year\u2026.\nAnd they are not paid for the labor of traveling to and from the mines or for the time they spend at the mines. The Indians, under the pretext of mining chores, are made to spend their workdays herding cattle and conveying goods; they are sent off to the plains, and the Indians die. These Indians are not paid for their labor, and their work is kept hidden.\nAnd [the mine owners] keep Indian cooking women in their residences; they use cooking as a pretext for taking concubines\u2026.And they oblige the Indians to accept corn or meat or chicha [corn beer]\u2026at their own expense, and they deduct the price from their labor and their workdays. In this way, the Indians end up very poor and deep in debt, and they have no way to pay their tribute.\nThere is no remedy for all this, because any [colonial official] who enters comes to an agreement with the mine owners, and all the owners join forces in bribing him\u2026.Even the protector of the Indians is useless;\u2026he [does not] warn Your Majesty or your royal Audiencia [court] about the harms done to the poor Indians.\"\nExcerpt from The First New Chronicle and Good Government [abridged], by Felipe Guaman Poma de Alaya.

Some years prior to her death, she conveyed a deed in fee simple to her oldest son. After her death, her youngest son filed a claim against the estate contending that the father's will devised only a life estate to his wife. A state statute said that a fee simple would be presumed where the intent of the testator did not clearly show an intent to devise a lesser estate. The lower court held that the widow had received a defeasible fee conditioned on her remaining a widow.

The woman allowed the cat to roam loose in the neighborhood. The cat frequently entered the backyard of a neighbor, who lived in the house next to the woman. The neighbor hated cats. One day, the neighbor looked out his kitchen window and saw the cat chewing on his prized rosebushes. The neighbor telephoned the woman and told her to retrieve her cat or he would kill it. The woman immediately ran over to the neighbor's property to get the cat. In the interim, the neighbor loaded his rifle and went outside. The woman saw the neighbor with the gun and said, \"Please don't shoot my cat. \" The neighbor responded, \"I'm sick and tired of her destroying my roses. \" The neighbor then pointed the rifle at the cat. Out of instinct, the woman dived toward the rosebushes to save her beloved cat. At that same moment, the neighbor's hand shook, and the rifle accidentally went off. The bullet narrowly missed the woman's head but struck the cat. Seeing her cat being shot, the woman was overcome with grief and became very emotionally distraught, which caused her to suffer a heart attack.

Yet we may be allowed to doubt whether the union was not a little too speedy and a little too thorough. It is surely carrying unity too far to wipe out all traces of the independent being, for most purposes to wipe out the very name, of such a land as Sicily. It jars on our feelings to find that, while Ireland at least forms part of the royal style of its sovereign, Sicily is no longer even a geographical expression. The island realm of Roger has sunk to be seven provinces of the kingdom on the mainland. And there is another result of Italian unity, a result in which we may rejoice without drawbacks, but which still has somewhat of sadness about it as finally ending that great phase of the history of Europe with which we have throughout been dealing. Never were ties with the past so fully snapped as when the army of Italy entered liberated Rome. Of all novelties in European history the greatest was when Rome became the centre of a dominion with acknowledged metes and bounds, the head in short of a local Italian kingdom. \"Rome the capital of Italy\" was a formula which might well gladden our hearts; but it was a formula which formally swept away the \u0153cumenical position, the \u0153cumenical traditions, of Rome&\u2026.\nBut the kingdom of Italy is not an appendage to Rome; Rome is the head of the kingdom. The whole is greater than its part; Rome, by her own free will and by the free will of Italy, has become less than Italy. By becoming the willing head of an Italian kingdom she has formally cast aside her Imperial traditions as they were not cast aside when brute force made her the head of a French department.\"\nEdward A.

Yet we may be allowed to doubt whether the union was not a little too speedy and a little too thorough. It is surely carrying unity too far to wipe out all traces of the independent being, for most purposes to wipe out the very name, of such a land as Sicily. It jars on our feelings to find that, while Ireland at least forms part of the royal style of its sovereign, Sicily is no longer even a geographical expression. The island realm of Roger has sunk to be seven provinces of the kingdom on the mainland. And there is another result of Italian unity, a result in which we may rejoice without drawbacks, but which still has somewhat of sadness about it as finally ending that great phase of the history of Europe with which we have throughout been dealing. Never were ties with the past so fully snapped as when the army of Italy entered liberated Rome. Of all novelties in European history the greatest was when Rome became the centre of a dominion with acknowledged metes and bounds, the head in short of a local Italian kingdom. \"Rome the capital of Italy\" was a formula which might well gladden our hearts; but it was a formula which formally swept away the \u0153cumenical position, the \u0153cumenical traditions, of Rome&\u2026.\nBut the kingdom of Italy is not an appendage to Rome; Rome is the head of the kingdom. The whole is greater than its part; Rome, by her own free will and by the free will of Italy, has become less than Italy. By becoming the willing head of an Italian kingdom she has formally cast aside her Imperial traditions as they were not cast aside when brute force made her the head of a French department.\"\nEdward A.

His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nChoice: \n(A) The ideas of personal liberty and nationalism conceived during the Enlightenment resulted in radical revolutions that could spread throughout Europe.(B) The conquest of Europe by Napoleon led to the creation of new factions and shifted the European balance of power.(C) The power of monarchs had grown to the point where it needed to be checked by other powers within each nation or domination of civilians would occur.(D) The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.\nQuestion_5: \nWhich of the following best states an argument made by James Madison in The Federalist number 10?\nChoice: \n(A) Honest politicians can prevent factions from developing.(B) Factions are more likely to occur in large republics than in small ones.(C) The negative effects of factionalism can be reduced by a republican government.(D) Free elections are the people's best defense against factionalism.\nAnswer_1: \nThe answer is (B) False, False\nAnswer_2: \nThe answer is (B) Business ethics management\nAnswer_3: \nThe answer is (B) Centromeres\nAnswer_4: \nThe answer is (A) The ideas of personal liberty and nationalism conceived during the Enlightenment resulted in radical revolutions that could spread throughout Europe.\nAnswer_5: \nThe answer is (C) The negative effects of factionalism can be reduced by a republican government.\n\nFollowing Questions: \nQuestion_6: \nIs the provision of security policy against terrorism a problematic pursuit?\nChoice: \n(A): 'Although trends suggest that terrorism shows little sign of abating there is some positive indication that international cooperation between countries will play an increasingly important role in collaboration with indigenous intelligence agencies. A meaningful international definition of terrorism would provide a useful framework for responding to the spectre of terrorism.'  (B): 'Responding to terrorism solely in its manifest form (the war on terror and crime approaches) holds little potential for eradicating terrorism in the long-term. It is clear that terrorism will remain a security threat for years to come unless the root causes are addressed. Countermeasures will prove fruitless (or a perpetual fight) unless nascent discontent is addressed before it is radicalized.'  (C): 'All of these options.'  (D): 'A concern with counter-terrorism efforts is the potential consequences on civil liberties.

Situated along the north shore of this island were coral reefs which are the home of a very rare species of fish that are found only along the north shore area. Congress conducted hearings to decide whether to authorize the construction of the naval base. During the hearings, one of the speakers who addressed the congressional committee was a famous expert on oceanography and marine biology. The expert vehemently opposed the naval plan and stated that the construction would, in his opinion, result in the extinction of the rare species of fish.

The expert has filed an action in federal district court seeking to enjoin the construction of the naval base on ecological grounds. Does the expert have adequate standing?\nChoice: \n(A): 'Yes, because he has a personal stake in the litigation. '  (B): 'Yes, because he is a recognized expert on marine biology and he testified at the congressional hearings. '  (C): 'No, because the suit presents a nonjusticiable political question.

In support of his contention, the officer seeks to introduce evidence that the man had resisted arrest on three prior occasions during the last 10 years. Is this testimony regarding the man's conduct during the three prior arrests admissible? \nChoice: \n(A): 'No, because evidence of the prior incidents constitutes impermissible character evidence.'  (B): 'No, because the officer has not shown that the man was convicted in connection with the prior incidents.'

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nChoice: \n(A) The ideas of personal liberty and nationalism conceived during the Enlightenment resulted in radical revolutions that could spread throughout Europe.(B) The conquest of Europe by Napoleon led to the creation of new factions and shifted the European balance of power.(C) The power of monarchs had grown to the point where it needed to be checked by other powers within each nation or domination of civilians would occur.(D) The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.\nQuestion_5: \nWhich of the following best states an argument made by James Madison in The Federalist number 10?\nChoice: \n(A) Honest politicians can prevent factions from developing.(B) Factions are more likely to occur in large republics than in small ones.(C) The negative effects of factionalism can be reduced by a republican government.(D) Free elections are the people's best defense against factionalism.\nAnswer_1: \nThe answer is (B) False, False\nAnswer_2: \nThe answer is (B) Business ethics management\nAnswer_3: \nThe answer is (B) Centromeres\nAnswer_4: \nThe answer is (A) The ideas of personal liberty and nationalism conceived during the Enlightenment resulted in radical revolutions that could spread throughout Europe.\nAnswer_5: \nThe answer is (C) The negative effects of factionalism can be reduced by a republican government.\n\nFollowing Questions: \nQuestion_6: \nWho was the immediate successor to Guru Nanak?\nChoice: \n(A): 'Guru Angad'  (B): 'His son'  (C): 'Guru Gobind Singh'  (D): 'Guru Hargobind'  \nQuestion_7: \nWhich of the following guidelines is applicable to initialization of the weight vector in a fully connected neural network.\nChoice: \n(A): 'Should not set it to zero since otherwise it will cause overfitting'  (B): 'Should not set it to zero since otherwise (stochastic) gradient descent will explore a very small space'  (C): 'Should set it to zero since otherwise it causes a bias'  (D): 'Should set it to zero in order to preserve symmetry across all neurons'  \nQuestion_8: \nOn October 1, Arthur mailed to Madison an offer to sell a tract of land located in Summerville for $13,000.

Due to the precipitous drop in oil prices, many oil companies have been forced to cut back on oil production and lay off many workers. As a result, unemployment has reached all-time high levels in several states. In order to alleviate this potentially catastrophic situation, the one of those state's legislatures recently enacted a statute requiring that 10% of all oil produced within the state be purchased by the state and reserved for use by state residents. The purpose of the statute was twofold: (1) it was intended to stimulate the oil industry within the state by encouraging more production and exploration, and (2) it was designed to create an oil reserve so that state residents and industries would not suffer unduly from future oil shortages. Subsequently, Congress enacted a statute forbidding states to reserve local resources for local use in this manner. Is this state statute constitutional?\nChoice: \n(A): 'Yes, because Congress has not expressly forbidden states to reserve local resources for local use. '  (B): 'Yes, because the state statute requires that the oil be used for the general welfare of the people in emergency situations. '  (C): 'No, because a state may not protect its residents from out-of-state competition for its natural resources without the express permission of Congress. '  (D): 'No, because application of the statute denies non-oil producing companies to equal protection of the law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. '  \nQuestion_24: \nFor which of the following statements are both the price change and quantity change determinable (for a particular good)?\nChoice: \n(A): 'Both the supply of and the demand for the good decrease.'

Two hours later, a man was driving northbound toward the intersection after having just smoked marijuana. Failing to yield, the man crashed into a vehicle, killing the other driver. If the student and the man are prosecuted for the other driver's death, who shall be held criminally liable?\nChoice: \n(A): 'The student only, because his conduct was the legal cause of the other driver's death. '  (B): 'The man only, because he was high on marijuana when he collided with the other driver's vehicle. '  (C): 'The man and the student, because their acts were concurrent causes of the other driver's death. '  (D): 'Neither the man nor the student, if the other driver had the last clear chance to avoid the accident.

A large number still remain, and to each of them it is only possible to dole out the least scrap of bread. We only give bread to those who would otherwise die. The staple dish here consists of mice, which the inhabitants hunt, so desperate are they from hunger. They devour roots which the animals cannot eat; one can, in fact, not put into words the things one sees. . . . This narrative, far from exaggerating, rather understates the horror of the case, for it does not record the hundredth part of the misery in this district. Those who have not witnessed it with their own eyes cannot imagine how great it is. Not a day passes but at least 200 people die of famine in the two provinces. We certify to having ourselves seen herds, not of cattle, but of men and women, wandering about the fields between Rheims and Rh\u00e9tel, turning up the earth like pigs to find a few roots; and as they can only find rotten ones, and not half enough of them, they become so weak that they have not strength left to seek food.

In order to alleviate this potentially catastrophic situation, the one of those state's legislatures recently enacted a statute requiring that 10% of all oil produced within the state be purchased by the state and reserved for use by state residents. The purpose of the statute was twofold: (1) it was intended to stimulate the oil industry within the state by encouraging more production and exploration, and (2) it was designed to create an oil reserve so that state residents and industries would not suffer unduly from future oil shortages. Subsequently, Congress enacted a statute forbidding states to reserve local resources for local use in this manner. Is this state statute constitutional?\nChoice: \n(A): 'Yes, because Congress has not expressly forbidden states to reserve local resources for local use. '  (B): 'Yes, because the state statute requires that the oil be used for the general welfare of the people in emergency situations.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte.

Realizing that the power to tax is the power to destroy and that the power to take a certain amount of property or of income is only another way of saying that for a certain proportion of his time a citizen must work for the government, the authority to impose a tax on the people has been most carefully guarded.\u2026 A government which lays taxes on the people not required by urgent necessity and sound public policy is not a protector of liberty, but an instrument of tyranny. It condemns the citizen to tyranny. One of the first signs of the breaking down of free government is a disregard by the taxing power of the right of the people to their own property.\u2026 Unless the people can enjoy that reasonable security in the possession of their property, which is guaranteed by the Constitution, against unreasonable taxation, freedom is at an end.\u2026 With us economy is imperative.

Women invested with the rights of citizens in one section\u2014voters, jurors, office-holders\u2014crossing an imaginary line, are subjects in the next. In some States, a married woman may hold property and transact business in her own name; in others, her earnings belong to her husband. In some States, a woman may testify against her husband, sue and be sued in the courts; in others, she has no redress in case of damage to person, property, or character. In case of divorce on account of adultery in the husband, the innocent wife is held to possess no right to children or property, unless by special decree of the court. But in no State of the Union has the wife the right to her own person, or to any part of the joint earnings of the co-partnership during the life of her husband.
