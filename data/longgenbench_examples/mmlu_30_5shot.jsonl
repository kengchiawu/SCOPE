It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nChoice: \n(A) The ideas of personal liberty and nationalism conceived during the Enlightenment resulted in radical revolutions that could spread throughout Europe.(B) The conquest of Europe by Napoleon led to the creation of new factions and shifted the European balance of power.(C) The power of monarchs had grown to the point where it needed to be checked by other powers within each nation or domination of civilians would occur.(D) The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.\nQuestion_5: \nWhich of the following best states an argument made by James Madison in The Federalist number 10?\nChoice: \n(A) Honest politicians can prevent factions from developing.(B) Factions are more likely to occur in large republics than in small ones.(C) The negative effects of factionalism can be reduced by a republican government.(D) Free elections are the people's best defense against factionalism.\nAnswer_1: \nThe answer is (B) False, False\nAnswer_2: \nThe answer is (B) Business ethics management\nAnswer_3: \nThe answer is (B) Centromeres\nAnswer_4: \nThe answer is (A) The ideas of personal liberty and nationalism conceived during the Enlightenment resulted in radical revolutions that could spread throughout Europe.\nAnswer_5: \nThe answer is (C) The negative effects of factionalism can be reduced by a republican government.\n\nFollowing Questions: \nQuestion_6: \nIn the assessment of visual fields which of the following is true?\nChoice: \n(A): 'A lesion at the optic chiasma leads to a homonymous hemianopia'  (B): 'Impulses from the retinal leave the eye via the optic radiation'  (C): 'An enlarged blind spot may occur because of papilloedema'  (D): 'The visual field examination maps out a patient's central vision'  \nQuestion_7: \nSimilar evolutionary changes occurring in two species that can be related or unrelated.\nChoice: \n(A): 'Divergent evolution'  (B): 'Convergent evolution'  (C): 'Parallel evolution'  (D): 'Coevolution'  \nQuestion_8: \nThis question refers to the following information.\nSource 1:\n\"You may well ask: \"Why direct action?

On behalf of his company, he borrowed $500,000 from a credit union for this purpose. The company was to repay the loan at the rate of $2,500 per month. The loan was secured by a mortgage on the building that housed the company's operation center. Eight months later, the company's sales started to drop and the company began experiencing cash flow problems. As a result, the company failed to make its loan payments for three consecutive months, causing the credit union to threaten to foreclose on the mortgage. The president's father, a retired wealthy investor, then intervened on behalf of the company, paid the three missed loan payments, and told the credit union that if they would refrain from any legal action against the company for a year, he would personally see that the debt was paid. The credit union orally agreed to the father's surety arrangement. However, it was never reduced to writing. Six months later, the company once again missed consecutive payments, and the credit union filed a foreclosure suit against the company. The father did not learn of the suit until a week later, but he raised no objection, since he thought the credit union was violating its agreement with him by foreclosing within the one-year period, thus relieving him of his part of the bargain. Two weeks later, the credit union's loan officer called the father and said that the credit union would hold off on the foreclosure suit as per their agreement, since the company had just made a new technological development that would place it in a very lucrative and competitive position.

Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nChoice: \n(A) The ideas of personal liberty and nationalism conceived during the Enlightenment resulted in radical revolutions that could spread throughout Europe.(B) The conquest of Europe by Napoleon led to the creation of new factions and shifted the European balance of power.(C) The power of monarchs had grown to the point where it needed to be checked by other powers within each nation or domination of civilians would occur.(D) The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.\nQuestion_5: \nWhich of the following best states an argument made by James Madison in The Federalist number 10?\nChoice: \n(A) Honest politicians can prevent factions from developing.(B) Factions are more likely to occur in large republics than in small ones.(C) The negative effects of factionalism can be reduced by a republican government.(D) Free elections are the people's best defense against factionalism.\nAnswer_1: \nThe answer is (B) False, False\nAnswer_2: \nThe answer is (B) Business ethics management\nAnswer_3: \nThe answer is (B) Centromeres\nAnswer_4: \nThe answer is (A) The ideas of personal liberty and nationalism conceived during the Enlightenment resulted in radical revolutions that could spread throughout Europe.\nAnswer_5: \nThe answer is (C) The negative effects of factionalism can be reduced by a republican government.\n\nFollowing Questions: \nQuestion_6: \nJonathan obtained a score of 80 on a statistics exam, placing him at the 90th percentile.

When the tenant took possession of the building, he notified the owner about the condition of the staircase and insisted that it be repaired. Although the owner orally promised the tenant that he would remedy the condition, he failed to do so. Later that evening, the tenant and his wife were receiving some friends for a small dinner party. One of the guests arrived at 7:00 p. m. and climbed the stairs to the second floor apartment.

In ascribing the salvation of the remnant of the people to the election of grace, Paul clearly testifies, that it is then only known that God saves whom upon which there can be no claim. They who shut the gates to prevent anyone from presuming to approach and taste this doctrine, do no less injury to man than to God; for nothing else will be sufficient to produce in us suitable humility, or to impress us with a due sense of our great obligations to God. Nor is there any other basis for solid confidence, even according to the authority of Christ, who, to deliver us from all fear, and render us invincible amidst so many dangers, snares, and deadly conflicts, promises to preserve in safety all whom the Father has committed to His care.\n\u2014John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, 1559\nWhich of the following was NOT an abuse of the Catholic Church that Calvin and other religious leaders criticized?\nChoice: \n(A): 'Papal wealth'  (B): 'Pluralism'  (C): 'Nepotism'  (D): 'Indulgences'  \nQuestion_11: \nHow many men has actress Elizabeth Taylor been divorced from?\nChoice: \n(A): 'five'  (B): 'six'  (C): 'seven'  (D): 'eight'  \nQuestion_12: \nThe philosophic insistence on providing a logos for the world and our experience of it might itself rely ultimately on adopting a certain mythos, insofar as:\nChoice: \n(A): 'philosophy assumes that it is possible and meaningful to reason about the world and experience.'

The customer refused, and the drunk man knocked him down and began beating his head against the floor. The drunk man woke up hours later in jail, with no memory of the events. The police charged him with aggravated assault, which required proof of specific intent. At trial, the drunk man asked for an additional jury charge of simple assault, which did not require specific intent. The trial court refused, and the drunk man was convicted of aggravated assault. On appeal, will the appeals court likely reverse for a new trial, ordering that a charge on simple assault be added?\nChoice: \n(A): 'Yes, because the lesser included crime must always be a part of the jury charge in order to allow the jury to pick and choose whichever crime it feels applies.'  (B): 'Yes, because the evidence of voluntary intoxication could rule out a finding of specific intent, and therefore the jury should have the choice of each crime before it.'

The photo is\nChoice: \n(A): 'admissible, for the limited purpose of showing that the stab wounds resulted from a butcher's knife. '  (B): 'admissible, because it is relevant to the prosecution's case, and all relevant evidence is, by its nature, admissible.

Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nChoice: \n(A) The ideas of personal liberty and nationalism conceived during the Enlightenment resulted in radical revolutions that could spread throughout Europe.(B) The conquest of Europe by Napoleon led to the creation of new factions and shifted the European balance of power.(C) The power of monarchs had grown to the point where it needed to be checked by other powers within each nation or domination of civilians would occur.(D) The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.\nQuestion_5: \nWhich of the following best states an argument made by James Madison in The Federalist number 10?\nChoice: \n(A) Honest politicians can prevent factions from developing.(B) Factions are more likely to occur in large republics than in small ones.(C) The negative effects of factionalism can be reduced by a republican government.(D) Free elections are the people's best defense against factionalism.\nAnswer_1: \nThe answer is (B) False, False\nAnswer_2: \nThe answer is (B) Business ethics management\nAnswer_3: \nThe answer is (B) Centromeres\nAnswer_4: \nThe answer is (A) The ideas of personal liberty and nationalism conceived during the Enlightenment resulted in radical revolutions that could spread throughout Europe.\nAnswer_5: \nThe answer is (C) The negative effects of factionalism can be reduced by a republican government.\n\nFollowing Questions: \nQuestion_6: \nMalnutrition in older adults is associated with which of the following?\n\nChoice: \n(A): 'An increased mortality and morbidity'  (B): 'Reduced length of hospital'  (C): 'An improvement in physical function'  (D): 'A reduced susceptibility to infection'  \nQuestion_7: \nThis question refers to the following information.\n\"When we were kids the United States was the wealthiest and strongest country in the world; the only one with the atom bomb, the least scarred by modern war, an initiator of the United Nations that we thought would distribute Western influence throughout the world.

But an internal tax is forced from the people without their consent if not laid by their own representatives. The Stamp Act says we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither marry nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such sums; and thus it is intended to extort our money from us or ruin us by the consequence of refusing to pay it.\"\n\u2014Benjamin Franklin, Examination before Parliament, 1766\nWhich author was most critical of the policy being described here by President Jackson?\nChoice: \n(A): 'Rachel Carson in Silent Spring.'

The written contract entered included a \"production fee clause\" that provided that the production company would be \"paid $100,000 for the filming and editing of ten 30-second commercials\" that would be suitable for the candidate's television campaign broadcasts. The production fee clause also stipulated that the $100,000 would be paid to the production company \"on condition that the filming and editing be directed under the personal supervision of the president of the production company. \" The contract made no other reference to compensation. Thereafter, the production company filmed and edited the ten campaign commercials, which the candidate approved.

Countermeasures will prove fruitless (or a perpetual fight) unless nascent discontent is addressed before it is radicalized.'  (C): 'All of these options.'  (D): 'A concern with counter-terrorism efforts is the potential consequences on civil liberties. The greatest danger comes when governments regard the battle against terrorism as warfare because most democratic countries permit greater restrictions on the rights of individuals during wartime.

The homeowner received notice that her uncle had passed away and left her a two-story mansion in a neighboring city. The homeowner decided to move her primary residence to the mansion and rent the ranch-style home. She entered into a one- year written lease agreement with a tenant. The agreement set the monthly rent at $1,000. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the home, he built, at his own expense, a room addition onto the home. The room addition increased the appraised market value of the home from $200,000 to $250,000. At the expiration of the lease, the homeowner informed the tenant that she had decided to sell the home. She offered the tenant the first opportunity to buy the home, but the tenant replied that he could not afford to do so. The tenant did claim that he should be entitled to compensation for the room addition, since it had increased the value of the home, and the homeowner agreed. The tenant and the homeowner then executed the following agreement:\"On the sale of the ranch-style home, the homeowner hereby promises to pay the tenant one- half of any sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, in compensation of the tenant's efforts in constructing the room addition onto the home. In addition, it is hereby agreed that the tenant may remain on the land until the sale is finalized, at a monthly rent of$500. ,'The homeowner initially set the asking price at $250,000, but received no offers to purchase the home. The homeowner decided to reduce the price to $210,000. This price reduction so infuriated the tenant that he thereafter made negative comments about the home to all of the prospective buyers who visited the home. Two months later, the homeowner sold the home to a buyer for $206,000. The buyer had visited the home while the tenant was away on a business trip and therefore did not hear the tenant's negative comments. Thereupon, the tenant, who had paid no rent for the final two months, moved out. After the sale was finalized, the homeowner refused to pay the tenant any of the sale proceeds. Which of the following statements, if true, most persuasively supports the tenant's contention that he is entitled to recover at least $4,000 from the owner (or the equivalent of one-half of the sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, minus two months' unpaid rent at $500 per month)?\nChoice: \n(A): 'The owner breached an implied promise by failing to attempt to sell the property at $250,000, which was the appraised market value of the home. '  (B): 'Since the tenant made no negative comments about the home to the buyer, there is no showing that the tenant's remarks to the other prospective buyers necessarily caused any loss to the owner (i. e. , prevented her from selling the home for more than $210,000). '  (C): 'The agreement between the homeowner that the tenant contained only one express condition (i. e. , the tenant was permitted to remain in the home during the owner's efforts to sell it), and since that condition has occurred, the tenant is entitled to his share of the proceeds from the sale. '  (D): 'Even if the tenant's failure to pay any rent for the last two months was a material breach of contract, the owner's promise to pay the tenant a share of the proceeds of the sale was an independent covenant.

A nonresident, in order to hunt elk, was required to purchase a combination license at a cost of $225. 00; this entitled him to take one elk, one deer, and one black bear. A nonresident, however, could obtain a license restricted to deer for $51. 00. A resident was not required to buy any combination of licenses but if he did, the cost to him of all the privileges granted by the nonresident combination license was $30. 00. Due to its successful management program for elk, the state has not been compelled to limit the overall number of hunters by means of drawings or lotteries, as have other states. Elk are not hunted commercially in the state. Nonresident hunters seek the animal for its trophy value; the trophy is the distinctive set of antlers.  \u0080\u0098.

The homeowner received notice that her uncle had passed away and left her a two-story mansion in a neighboring city. The homeowner decided to move her primary residence to the mansion and rent the ranch-style home. She entered into a one- year written lease agreement with a tenant. The agreement set the monthly rent at $1,000. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the home, he built, at his own expense, a room addition onto the home. The room addition increased the appraised market value of the home from $200,000 to $250,000. At the expiration of the lease, the homeowner informed the tenant that she had decided to sell the home. She offered the tenant the first opportunity to buy the home, but the tenant replied that he could not afford to do so. The tenant did claim that he should be entitled to compensation for the room addition, since it had increased the value of the home, and the homeowner agreed. The tenant and the homeowner then executed the following agreement:\"On the sale of the ranch-style home, the homeowner hereby promises to pay the tenant one- half of any sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, in compensation of the tenant's efforts in constructing the room addition onto the home. In addition, it is hereby agreed that the tenant may remain on the land until the sale is finalized, at a monthly rent of$500. ,'The homeowner initially set the asking price at $250,000, but received no offers to purchase the home. The homeowner decided to reduce the price to $210,000. This price reduction so infuriated the tenant that he thereafter made negative comments about the home to all of the prospective buyers who visited the home. Two months later, the homeowner sold the home to a buyer for $206,000. The buyer had visited the home while the tenant was away on a business trip and therefore did not hear the tenant's negative comments. Thereupon, the tenant, who had paid no rent for the final two months, moved out. After the sale was finalized, the homeowner refused to pay the tenant any of the sale proceeds. Which of the following statements, if true, most persuasively supports the tenant's contention that he is entitled to recover at least $4,000 from the owner (or the equivalent of one-half of the sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, minus two months' unpaid rent at $500 per month)?\nChoice: \n(A): 'The owner breached an implied promise by failing to attempt to sell the property at $250,000, which was the appraised market value of the home. '  (B): 'Since the tenant made no negative comments about the home to the buyer, there is no showing that the tenant's remarks to the other prospective buyers necessarily caused any loss to the owner (i. e. , prevented her from selling the home for more than $210,000). '  (C): 'The agreement between the homeowner that the tenant contained only one express condition (i. e. , the tenant was permitted to remain in the home during the owner's efforts to sell it), and since that condition has occurred, the tenant is entitled to his share of the proceeds from the sale. '  (D): 'Even if the tenant's failure to pay any rent for the last two months was a material breach of contract, the owner's promise to pay the tenant a share of the proceeds of the sale was an independent covenant.

Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\nChoice: \n(A) The ideas of personal liberty and nationalism conceived during the Enlightenment resulted in radical revolutions that could spread throughout Europe.(B) The conquest of Europe by Napoleon led to the creation of new factions and shifted the European balance of power.(C) The power of monarchs had grown to the point where it needed to be checked by other powers within each nation or domination of civilians would occur.(D) The rising and falling economic cycle of the newly emerging capitalist economy could lead to civilian unrest that must be suppressed.\nQuestion_5: \nWhich of the following best states an argument made by James Madison in The Federalist number 10?\nChoice: \n(A) Honest politicians can prevent factions from developing.(B) Factions are more likely to occur in large republics than in small ones.(C) The negative effects of factionalism can be reduced by a republican government.(D) Free elections are the people's best defense against factionalism.\nAnswer_1: \nThe answer is (B) False, False\nAnswer_2: \nThe answer is (B) Business ethics management\nAnswer_3: \nThe answer is (B) Centromeres\nAnswer_4: \nThe answer is (A) The ideas of personal liberty and nationalism conceived during the Enlightenment resulted in radical revolutions that could spread throughout Europe.\nAnswer_5: \nThe answer is (C) The negative effects of factionalism can be reduced by a republican government.\n\nFollowing Questions: \nQuestion_6: \nAppeal to authority involves\nChoice: \n(A): 'arguing that a claim should be accepted based only on the evidence that prestigious people accept it'  (B): 'arguing that small changes will lead to significant effects, when there is no evidence the effects will be that significant'  (C): 'arguing that a claim should be accepted based only on the evidence that an authority figure agrees with it'  (D): 'reasoning that a claim must be true based only on the evidence that it has been claimed quite often'  \nQuestion_7: \nAlex grows an initial culture of 100 Rhizopus stolonifer fungi on a sample of bread.

The homeowner received notice that her uncle had passed away and left her a two-story mansion in a neighboring city. The homeowner decided to move her primary residence to the mansion and rent the ranch-style home. She entered into a one- year written lease agreement with a tenant. The agreement set the monthly rent at $1,000. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the home, he built, at his own expense, a room addition onto the home. The room addition increased the appraised market value of the home from $200,000 to $250,000. At the expiration of the lease, the homeowner informed the tenant that she had decided to sell the home. She offered the tenant the first opportunity to buy the home, but the tenant replied that he could not afford to do so. The tenant did claim that he should be entitled to compensation for the room addition, since it had increased the value of the home, and the homeowner agreed. The tenant and the homeowner then executed the following agreement:\"On the sale of the ranch-style home, the homeowner hereby promises to pay the tenant one- half of any sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, in compensation of the tenant's efforts in constructing the room addition onto the home. In addition, it is hereby agreed that the tenant may remain on the land until the sale is finalized, at a monthly rent of$500. ,'The homeowner initially set the asking price at $250,000, but received no offers to purchase the home. The homeowner decided to reduce the price to $210,000. This price reduction so infuriated the tenant that he thereafter made negative comments about the home to all of the prospective buyers who visited the home. Two months later, the homeowner sold the home to a buyer for $206,000. The buyer had visited the home while the tenant was away on a business trip and therefore did not hear the tenant's negative comments. Thereupon, the tenant, who had paid no rent for the final two months, moved out. After the sale was finalized, the homeowner refused to pay the tenant any of the sale proceeds. Which of the following statements, if true, most persuasively supports the tenant's contention that he is entitled to recover at least $4,000 from the owner (or the equivalent of one-half of the sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, minus two months' unpaid rent at $500 per month)?\nChoice: \n(A): 'The owner breached an implied promise by failing to attempt to sell the property at $250,000, which was the appraised market value of the home. '  (B): 'Since the tenant made no negative comments about the home to the buyer, there is no showing that the tenant's remarks to the other prospective buyers necessarily caused any loss to the owner (i. e. , prevented her from selling the home for more than $210,000). '  (C): 'The agreement between the homeowner that the tenant contained only one express condition (i. e. , the tenant was permitted to remain in the home during the owner's efforts to sell it), and since that condition has occurred, the tenant is entitled to his share of the proceeds from the sale.

It was greatly developed under the r\u00e9gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte.

A large number still remain, and to each of them it is only possible to dole out the least scrap of bread. We only give bread to those who would otherwise die. The staple dish here consists of mice, which the inhabitants hunt, so desperate are they from hunger. They devour roots which the animals cannot eat; one can, in fact, not put into words the things one sees. . . . This narrative, far from exaggerating, rather understates the horror of the case, for it does not record the hundredth part of the misery in this district.

The man was convicted of selling large quantities of an illegal drug from his house. Acting under a state law authorizing the destruction of buildings that are used for illegal activity, the city destroyed the man\u00d5s house. The man\u00d5s family then rented an apartment and demanded that the city pay the rent for that temporary residence. The family relied on a state law providing that any person who was dispossessed of his or her place of residence because of the actions of city officials was entitled to replacement housing at the city\u00d5s expense until permanent substitute housing could be found. When the city refused to pay the rent for the apartment, the man\u00d5s family sued the city in a state trial court claiming a right to such payment under both the state law and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The highest state court ruled for the family. Although the court decided that the family had no right to payment under the state law, it held that the Fourteenth Amendment entitled the family to payment of the rent for the temporary apart-ment. In its opinion, the highest state court indicated that in several of its decisions it had found cities liable for compen-sation in similar situations on the basis of the due process clause of the state constitution. But the highest state court declined to base its holding on the state constitution because that issue had not been properly raised in the case. The city then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the United States Supreme Court. Does the Court have jurisdiction to review the merits of this case?\nChoice: \n(A): 'Yes, because the highest state court based its decision wholly on federal law grounds.'  (B): 'Yes, because the federal and state law issues in this case are so intertwined that a resolution of the federal law issues is necessary to facilitate a proper determination of the state law issues.'  (C): 'No, because the decision of the highest state court ren-ders the case moot.'

Hewlett installed the program; Packard set up the secret account. The three bankers meet periodically to check the account, but they have not yet built up enough of a balance to make a withdrawal. Mac, an honest co-worker, gets wind of the plan and threatens to expose the group. Hewlett pulls Mac into a bank vault room and warns, \"You'd better be quiet about this or you're gonna get it.\" Packard gets wind of the threat and decides things have gone too far. Packard closes the account and goes to the police station, where he tells an inspector the whole story. Meanwhile, Avery secretly \"borrows\" a bank computer to monitor the progress of his program from home. Impressed with how fast it downloads, Avery decides to keep the bank's computer.

They who shut the gates to prevent anyone from presuming to approach and taste this doctrine, do no less injury to man than to God; for nothing else will be sufficient to produce in us suitable humility, or to impress us with a due sense of our great obligations to God.
